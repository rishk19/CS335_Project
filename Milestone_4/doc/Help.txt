The flags availiable :
    --verbose : Use to switch on the debugger of bison
    --input= : Use to specify input file
    --output= : Use to specify output file

To compile the parser for the first time, on the Milestone_1 directory run the code
    make parse
    
To compile the parser again first run :
    make clean  
    make parse

If the last compilation had not failed, Parser can be compiled again :
    make all

The executable for the parser is in the bin folder. To parse a java file run :
    cd bin
    ./parser --input= "PATH TO INPUT FILE" --ouput= "PATH TO OUTPUT FILE"

If you want to run our test suite then from the folder Milestone_1 run :
    make test
And then give the test_suite number and the output file would be in the output folder.

If you wnat to test all the  test suite in one go, run:
    make test_many
You will be prompted to enter number of test cases to run in one go, so enter :
    25 (to run 25 test cases)

All the output three address code generated in stored in output/ folder
To create a pdf file of the graph use the following command :   
    dot −Tpdf "PATH TO INPUT FILE" −o "PATH TO OUTPUT FILE"
