Welcome to Help Mode !!

The flags availiable :
    --verbose : Use to switch on the debugger of bison
    --input= : Use to specify input file
    --output= : Use to specify output file

To compile the compiler on the Milestone_4 directory run the code
    make parse
    
To clean the binaries run the code :
    make clean

The executable for the parser is in the bin folder. To compile a java file run :
    cd bin
    ./parser --input= "PATH TO INPUT FILE" --ouput= "PATH TO OUTPUT FILE"
Then in the output file the assembly would be generated.

If you want to make an assembly of our test suite then from the folder Milestone_4 run :
    make test
And then give the test_suite number and the output file would be in the output folder.

If you wnat to make the assembly of multiple test suite in one go, run:
    make test_many
You will be prompted to enter number of test cases to run in one go, so enter :
    25 (to run 25 test cases)

If you want to run our test suite then from the folder Milestone_4 run :
    make run
And then give the test_suite number and the output file would be in the output folder. The output would be generated in a .txt file.

If you want to run multiple test suite in one go, run:
    make test_many
You will be prompted to enter number of test cases to run in one go, so enter :
    25 (to run 25 test cases)
